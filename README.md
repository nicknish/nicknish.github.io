Code and happiness. âœŒ

## Getting Started

First, `bundle install`.

Because Github Pages runs off of master branch, dev on the branch `source`:

* `jekyll s` to boot up your local server.

Then, when you want to publish it live:

* `rake publish` to generate assets, take the commits on source, and push it to master with timestamps.
