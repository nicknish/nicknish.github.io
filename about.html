<article class="mbxl">
  <p>I'm Nick Nish, a passion developer with a deep love for creating great products and the craft of telling important stories. Because my love for frontend, I consider myself a frontend developer first, but Iâ€™m wonderfully full-stack â€“ JavaScript, React/Redux, Ruby, Rails, are all fair game.</p>

  <p>Conversations of product, design, and brand building get me excited.</p>

  <p>I aim to be deeply happy.</p>

  <p>I learn everyday without fail. My life's joy is in being a lifelong learner.</p>

  <p>I meditate and strive to carry joy in everything I do.</p>

  <p>I have a wonderful family and girlfriend.</p>

  <p>Here's <a href="{{site.navigation.work}}">some of the work</a> I've done.</p>

  <p>Here's what I'm up to <a href="{{site.navigation.now}}">now</a>.</p>
