## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick Nish, a passion developer with a deep love for creating great products and the craft of telling important stories. Because my love for frontend, I consider myself a frontend developer first, but Iâ€™m wonderfully full-stack â€“ JavaScript, React/Redux, Ruby, Rails, are all fair game.

Conversations of product, design, and brand building get me excited.

I aim to be deeply happy.

I learn everyday without fail. My life's joy is in being a lifelong learner.

I meditate and strive to carry joy in everything I do.

I have a wonderful family and girlfriend.


Here's what I'm up to [now](/now).
